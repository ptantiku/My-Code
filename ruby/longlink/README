A Ruby script for expanding the shortened URL link.
This works by:
    1. Try to connect to the link.
    2. Capture the HTTP Header, no need to download HTML body
    3. If the link is redirection link(i.e. shortened link), 
       HTTP Header will have status 3XX (300-399)
    4. Redirected URL will be in the field, 'Location'
    5. Repeat step 1-5 again until the link is not redirection link
